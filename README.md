ðŸš— Smart Parking Management Database System

ðŸ“Œ Overview:
As part of our 4th-semester database module, my team Chathura Dilshantha, Dinuth Dilruksha, and Iâ€”collaboratively designed and implemented a relational database system for smart parking management. We followed a systematic approach, starting from requirement analysis to database tuning, delivering a robust and efficient solution.

ðŸ‘¥ Key Contributions:
 1. Requirement Analysis:
 â­• Collaboratively identified and documented the functional and data requirements for the database schema.

2. Conceptual Design:
 â­• Created UML Class Diagrams and Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams using Visual Paradigm.
 â­• ER diagrams featured:
 ðŸ”¹ At least 6 strong entities and 2 weak entities.
 ðŸ”¹ Recursive relationships, multivalued and composite attributes, derived attributes, and entities with multiple candidate keys.
 ðŸ”¹ Applied (min, max) structural constraints and role names in relationships for precise modeling.

3. Implementation:
 â­• Developed the database schema in MySQL adhering to 2NF standards.
 â­• Defined tables, implemented schema creation, and conducted all CRUD operations with sample data to demonstrate functionality.

4. Transactions:
 â­• Wrote and executed 20 queries:
 ðŸ”¹ 7 simple queries for foundational operations like SELECT, PROJECT, aggregation, and user-defined views.
 ðŸ”¹ 13 advanced queries involving complex relational algebra operations, set operations, and joins.

5. Database Tuning:
 â­• Optimized 10 complex queries using indexing and query tuning techniques.
 â­• Used EXPLAIN statements to compare performance metrics before and after optimization, showcasing significant efficiency improvements.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
 MySQL, Visual Paradigm

ðŸ’¡ Skills Gained:
 Through this 4th-semester project, our team strengthened our expertise in relational database design, query optimization, transaction management, and indexing techniques.
